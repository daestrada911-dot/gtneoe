# GTNEOE — Getting to Know Each Other, Enhanced

This project is Diego Estrada’s expandable “getting to know you” single-page app built for Intro to Computer Science. It bundles HTML/CSS/JS enhancements (tabs, modal, theming, and lightbox) so classmates can remix the template and deploy it with CI/CD.

## Highlights
- Responsive “boxes within boxes” layout featuring semantic sections, tabs, and cards.
- Accessible theme toggle with `localStorage` and keyboard-friendly tab navigation.
- CI/CD primer modal to reinforce the class workflow and requirements.
- Optional background music toggle so you can showcase your vibe while visitors browse.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository, then open `index.html` in your browser or serve it locally (`npx serve` or your favorite static server).
2. Replace the `EDIT ME` callouts with your own profile info, links, and fun facts.
3. Drop an MP3 named `background.mp3` in the project root if you want the soundtrack feature.
4. Validate the markup with the W3C validator and run your automated checks before deploying to GitHub Pages or your preferred host.
